This bot is mostly on alucard wich can be found here: https://github.com/AlucardSB/Alucard-Selfbot-src theres more explanation about alucard on that repo.

Im just using it to learn a bit but if you want you can use it, it has many new commands and stuff.

Note: You need Python 3.8 to use it.

Everything you can see here has been made for educational purposes and proof of concepts. I do not promote the usage of this tool, I do not take responsability on the bad usage of this tool. Selbots are against Discord TOS i do not take responsibility if you get banned
