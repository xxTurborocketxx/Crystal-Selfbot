1. Go to discord
2. Click CTRL, Shift and i at the same time
Once doing this a white or black box at the right side of your discord should pop up.
3. On the top, click the little double arrow at the top, to the right of "Network"
4. In the drop down, click "Application"
5. In the sub category where it says "Storage", click the drop down on "Local Storage"
6. Scroll down all the way in the little table it opens
7. Do control + r
This will restart your discord. We need to get discord to send your token to the auth server again so we can get it and save it so the selfbot can send messages, etc.
8. At the bottom of a table, a new column should appear called "token". Double click into the "Value" column and then copy it. (You will have about five seconds to do this before it dissapears.)

Note: You will need to deactivate 2-Step because if you don't the bot will not be able to send messages, only read them

If you go to the config.json, you are able to set your prefix.
Your prefix is the character you have to type in order for the bot to know you are talking to it.
If your prefix is "-" you will do -help. If your prefix is "." you will do .help

# Q&A
- Q: **`SSL Certificate Error`**
- A: Just install [CRT File](https://crt.sh/?id=2835394). Then run it and install. (This is common and it was a certificate that expired May 30th 2020. But a new one came out so install it.). If you wanna go into further detail then head to [SITE](https://support.sectigo.com/Com_KnowledgeDetailPage?Id=kA03l00000117LT).  
- Q: **`Module Missing`**
- A: Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in console. This insures that all modules required for Alucard are installed and up to date!
- Q: **`Windll not found`**
- A: Alucard uses some windows features from modules. Example windll from ctypes. windll is used to add the console title. You can remove the title setters in-order to fix it.
- Q: **`TypeError: __new__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'deny_new'`**
- A: This error occured on an old installation of discord.py to fix simply run :`pip install -U discord.py` this updates discord.py!
